        LAMBDA: A Large Model Based Data Agent
    </div>

    <div class="section-content">
        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p style="">
            We introduce LArge Model Based Data Agent (LAMBDA), a novel open-source,
code-free multi-agent data analysis system that leverages the power of large models.
LAMBDA is designed to address data analysis challenges in complex data-driven
applications through innovatively designed data agents that operate iteratively and
generatively using natural language. At the core of LAMBDA are two key agent
roles: the programmer and the inspector, which are engineered to work together
seamlessly. Specifically, the programmer generates code based on the userâ€™s instructions
and domain-specific knowledge, enhanced by advanced models. Meanwhile, the
inspector debugs the code when necessary. To ensure robustness and handle adverse
scenarios, LAMBDA features a user interface that allows direct user intervention
in the operational loop. Additionally, LAMBDA can flexibly integrate external
models and algorithms through our proposed Knowledge Integration Mechanism,
catering to the needs of customized data analysis. LAMBDA has demonstrated strong
performance on various data analysis tasks. It has the potential to enhance data
analysis paradigms by seamlessly integrating human and artificial intelligence, making
it more accessible, effective, and efficient for users from diverse backgrounds. The
strong performance of LAMBDA in solving data analysis problems is demonstrated
using real-world data examples. Videos of several case studies are available at below. </p>
